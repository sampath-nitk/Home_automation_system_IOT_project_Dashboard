# Home_automation_system_IOT_project_Dashboard
The home automation system IoT project is a smart home system that integrates various devices 
and appliances into a centralized control system. The system is based on the Internet of Things 
(IoT) technology, which enables communication and data exchange among different devices. The 
project includes the development of a mobile application that enables users to control their home 
appliances remotely, as well as a central hub that serves as the main controller for the entire 
system. The system can be programmed to automate various tasks, such as turning on and off 
lights, adjusting thermostats, and controlling security systems. The project aims to provide a 
more convenient and efficient way of managing home appliances and systems, while also 
promoting energy conservation and cost savings. The aim is to create a home automation system 
that performs all basic functions of a virtual assistant like telling the time, date, temperature and 
also controlling the electrical appliances that it is connected to. The entire system is aimed to be 
voice operated so that there is no need to type anything at all. Apart from the voice operated 
commands, the system will also take the help of certain sensors to provide automation to certain 
appliances.

Steps
1. Firstly, we should create sinricPro account and add the devices to it
2. next we have to do the circuit as shown in the figure
3. then we should open Arduino and install esp32 , sinricpro libraryâ€™s.
4.once installed then we have to upload the the code.
5.once the code is uploaded without any error we need to connect to that network through a smart 
phone.
6. Now open your Google home app on your smartphone.connect the sinricPro account with 
Google home app . Give the voice command same as created .
7.When the voice command is sent through Google assistant it reaches the sinricPro server.
8.Then esp32 will receive and process it then it is sent to rely which will turn off or on the bulb 
accordingly.
